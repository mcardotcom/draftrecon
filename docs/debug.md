# DraftRecon Signup Debugging

## Current State

### What's Working âœ…

- Supabase trigger function (`handle_new_user`) now correctly references `raw_user_meta_data`
- Function successfully creates profiles in either `talent_profiles` or `hire_profiles` based on user role from metadata
- Database schema and trigger are up to date with latest migrations

### Issues Encountered ðŸš¨

1. **Signup 500 Errors**
   - Primary cause: Duplicate username in `talent_profiles` (unique constraint violation)
   - Impact: Failed signup attempts

2. **Supabase Auth Rate Limiting**
   - Occurs when attempting signup with same email within 60 seconds
   - Note: User may still be created in `auth.users` despite rate limit error

3. **Magic Link Email Issues**
   - Emails not consistently received
   - Can occur due to:
     - Failed signup transactions
     - Rate limiting

4. **Orphaned Users**
   - Failed signups can leave users in `auth.users` without corresponding profile rows

### Actions Taken ðŸ”§

1. Code Changes
   - Cleaned up trigger function to use only `raw_user_meta_data`
   - Added debug logging to trigger

2. Investigation
   - Reviewed Supabase logs
   - Identified unique constraint violation on username as root cause

3. Cleanup
   - Deleted test users and profiles for fresh signup attempts

### Next Steps ðŸ“‹

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Ensure unique usernames and emails for each signup
   - Clean up orphaned users and duplicate usernames in tables
   - Wait 60 seconds between signup attempts with same email

2. **Potential Improvements**
   - Add username availability check to signup form for better UX
   - Implement better error handling for rate limiting
   - Add cleanup routine for orphaned users

### Current Status Summary

The system is now in a state where:
- Database trigger is functioning correctly
- Main blockers are unique constraint violations and rate limiting
- Signup will work successfully with:
  - New email address
  - Unique username
  - Proper timing (respecting rate limits)
