Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Project Name:** DraftRecon  
**Version:** MVP v0.1  
**Owner:** Michail  
**Date:** June 2025  

---

## üîπ 1. Overview

**DraftRecon** is a high-signal, low-noise scouting platform where AI-assisted builders and automation pros showcase their work on ‚Äúplayer cards.‚Äù Instead of job applications, companies *scout and draft* talent based on what they‚Äôve built.

The MVP flips the hiring model by starting with builder visibility, not resumes.

---

## üîπ 2. Goals

- Enable talent to create and publish scouting cards that showcase what they‚Äôve built.
- Allow companies to view and save talent cards without traditional job posts.
- Keep the platform private, clean, and non-social.
